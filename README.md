# End Notes ðŸ“‘
In this project we have tried to  clone  the original website as much as possible. This entire journey of this Unit-4 construct week has given us 
experiences and we have learned lots of things about REACT, REDUX by applying to the real website and it gave us a lot more confidence in the REACT framework. Most of the features are added and functionality of the website are achieved.

# Limitations
Pages are not responsive yet and all the pages are not dynamic also, those pages might not be properly visible on small screen devices as we were given only 6 days to clone the website.
